4/15/2024 meeting with Ding notes

run again using original data, fixed number of pca and clusters at each level 

change the value a little bit tp see if consistent to see inference 


if everything looks good<>>>>> kmeans::: take first 2 compt and do kmean


where will pueto rico go if we push the clusters???


think about puerto about underrerpesentatiosn of puerto rico, on the other hand how has the government promoted this situation... why has this not changed so far?? what other differneces are there with land locked states


put more features such as salary, payments etc. 
imputation to make something roubust reguardless of change. 

if zero changes then it is artifact
